# Tools and Skills

Skills: Nothing special.  

Think twice, cut once - all skills neccessary for this project are achievable
just by doing it again and getting some practice. 

## Cutting aluminium

To cut aluminium in the right (square) angle, you need a limit stop for your cuts.
The best way to cut it straight, is a miter saw.

You might want to cut also 45Â° angles, it is really difficult to get a good
repeat accuracy with a handheld saw or an angle grinder. 

If you have no miter saw - try to rent one.

I bought a [aluminum / light metal blade from
Freud](https://www.sautershop.de/kreissaegeblatt-hm-190-x-2.5/1.6-x-20-mm-z-56-fr-fr13a001h)
for my mitersaw.

These profiles are really easy to cut (if you running an aluminium blade), but
afterwards there are tons of saw chips everywhere - even with proper vacuum
suction (DO NOT VACUUM HOT METAL CHIPS INTO YOUR WOOD DUST COLLECTION BIN - it
might burn your workshop down!)

Do your workshop a favor and run these cuts somewhere outside - the chips will not
polute any steel with rust.

I do not see any abrasion/usage signs on the sawblade after i finished all cuts.
The cuts where so good that i did not needed to file down the cuts.

## Workshop?

I am not sure if it would be satisfying to build this on the kitchen table. 
It would be possible, besides the aluminium cuts.

## Measureing

I really like my new marking tool, a steel needle. Very thin line for accurate cuts.
Use a good square to run the marks.

The cut of an circular saw blade is about 2mm wide - so think twice on which
side of the mark you will do the cut ; cut always on the 'scrap' part of the
mark and not in the actual piece you will use.

To measure the right lenght i used a tape measure. Its more accurate while it has
its own limit stop at one end and its more easy to handle in a confined space
than a folding rule. 

## Hand tools

Nothing special. 

A hex/allen key, some screwdrivers.

## Drill, Thread cutter

Aluminium and Polypropylene are easy to drill materials. I used my default hss
metal drill bits and a cheap thread cutter from the local hardware store and a
cordless drill.

## 3d printer

I run a 3d printer, but i do not feel it as my hobby to configure and tweak 3d
printers to the max.

If you just want to build prototypes like me, run a Prusa Printer.  Someone
else tweaked them before they started to selling them, and my [Prusa
MK3S](https://www.prusa3d.com/de/kategorie/original-prusa-i3-mk3s/) works like
new since 2017.

Nearly all my prints are printed with PETG. I do not use PLA at all.

I started drawing pieces in 2017 with
[Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.de/products/fusion-360/overview), and while i
am used to it, i never changed to more open software. 

If you do not own a printer, find a local maker space or use a printservice as
[Craftcloud3d](https://craftcloud3d.com)

## Hot cutter

This is expensive for a single use event. I had one for other purposes already
and used it.  If you are in soldering, search for a suitable blade for your
soldering iron. I know that at least Ersa has some.

Its also possible to use a sharp cutter knife.

## Hot glue pistol

Do not use hotglue with [aluminum until you are able to
preheat](frame-box-connection.md#glue) it.  Aluminium will eat up all heat from
the glue directly and the open time of the glue is nearly no time. 

If you try to hot glue on areas bigger then some centimeters, use a decent
pistol, not this shitty, cheap things from your local hardware store. They are not
able to heat the glue fast enought if you need a lot of glue.

This one did its job, but the aluminium was faster to spread the heat away as i
could glue and set the displays...
