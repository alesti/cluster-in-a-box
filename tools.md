## Sawing aluminium

I bought a [aluminum / light metal blade from
Freud](https://www.sautershop.de/kreissaegeblatt-hm-190-x-2.5/1.6-x-20-mm-z-56-fr-fr13a001h)
for my Makita mitersaw.

These profiles are really easy to cut with the mighty miter saw (if you running
an aluminium blade), but afterwards there are tons of saw chips everywhere -
even with proper vacuum suction (DO NOT VACUUM HOT METAL CHIPS INTO YOUR WOOD
DUST COLLECTION BIN - it might burn your workshop down!

Do your workshop a favor and run these cuts outside - it will not polute any steel
with rust.

I do not see any abrasion/usage signs on the sawblade after i finished all cuts.

## Measureing

Steel needle, caliper
