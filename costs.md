# Costs and Bill of material

Again: **This is a expensive project with questionable benefit.** 

You have been warned.

It is relatively easy to list the cost for the box, rig and tools, but
difficult for the odroids (and their parts), switches, as i had them already
and most of them are inherited - i did not pay all of the electrical stuff by
myself.

The expenses for the computer hardware (boards, nvme storage, memory, switches,
network cables, ...) are easy to research with the product links on the
[hardware](hardware.md) page.

There are no costs for the [printed parts](tools.md#3d-printer) listed - i do
not know them (filament; heat (electricity) might be the major part).

All expenses are in Euro, i bought all parts in the table below in spring /
early summer 2024 in Hamburg, Germany. 

Your milage may vary - ask your favorite search engine for costs in your area.
