# Connect the inner cage to the case

I am not yet sure if i want to connect the alu frame in a solid way to the case. 
But if, i need to explore the possibilities.

This is also an extra chapter [Connect the Rack with the Box](box-connection.md)

There are slots on the brim of the lid and the bottom, and the manufacturer has
matching hardware to slot in.  I am pretty sure that i will not use this in the
bottom, but i might use them in the lid.

## Rivets and Screws:

Typical connections left are glueing and riveting/screwing.  Screwing and
riveting will reduce the water tightness, but i would not care. But there are
holes in it afterwards.

## Glue

The case is made from polypropylen which counts as a low adhesive material.
This needs special glue, i found two types:

- 2 component glue from M3 Scotch which will not selled to private persons and
  even not to profesional gluers without having them a special mandatory
  security instruction.
- a hot glue system which is easy to handle
