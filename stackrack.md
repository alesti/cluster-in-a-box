## Odroids in a stackable rackmount 

I printed a case with parts of
[Odroid H2 Rackmount project](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3485530) - the H3 
have the same physical specs as the H2.

An improved version with H2 types and better fan distribution (february 2023) on the left:

I burned a lot of smaller filament remains down, so it has really ugly colours :-)
[Here are some more pictures](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOEYq0544IV67harl58_uC0024xNleLqJeiRTEjn7_saC3fTc6Ne1Pnuho2mmJ2EA?key=SUhpWUtIOFYzX0pybnV2RXV3aVNjRk9uWXVsazFR) 

This case design is genius while it is not only endless stackable but it
has also cages/bays and caddies, the Boards are mounted to the caddies and
are easy removable from the rack. Thats not the case (sic!) at our company labcluster
case, it is really a mess to change a node, if neccessary.

The switch is just 1mm to big to fit into a cage, thats why it lives on the top
without the vertical columns around it.

I used 3mm rod to connect the units, the holes are for much bigger rod, so i
printed some spacers and pressed them into the connections between the units
([these blue tubes](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOEYq0544IV67harl58_uC0024xNleLqJeiRTEjn7_saC3fTc6Ne1Pnuho2mmJ2EA/photo/AF1QipOLIP7ZdU2PIErlum0OlAI_0ENNHN7T6_IcpPRl?key=SUhpWUtIOFYzX0pybnV2RXV3aVNjRk9uWXVsazFR)).

The whole thing is easy movable if neccessary. A vest pocket cluster.

For the 2nd set (H2 type) i wanted to use dedicated fans for each node, so i
created another [fan connector which fits directly on one hight unit of the rack
mount kit](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5867495).
