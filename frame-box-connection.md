# Connect the inner cage to the case

I am not sure yet if i want to connect the alu frame in a solid way to the case. 
It might be also possible to establish a tight fit but no direct connection.

But if, i need to explore the possibilities.

There are slots on the brim of the lid and the bottom, and the manufacturer has
matching hardware to slot in.

I am pretty sure that i will not use these in the
bottom, but i might use them in the lid.

Typical connections left are glueing and riveting/screwing.

## Rivets and Screws

Screwing and riveting will reduce the water tightness of the case, but i do 
not care. But there are holes in it afterwards.

The box has really rugged surface on the outside, it would need good planing to
find spots with no webs, web connections and similar.

It might be possibe to drill holes with a template from the inside and use M5
screws which washers Karosseriescheiben connect into t-slot nuts. 

I am pretty sure not to use rivets in that case, even if i have the tools to
set proper rivets.  I like connections which are revertable without a drill.

## Glue

Read the last sentence again :-) But anyhow:

The case is made from polypropylene which counts as a low adhesive and hard to bond material.
This needs special glue, i found three types:

- Acrylat based super glue, but they are not very elastic and do not fill gaps
- [3M Scotch Weld DP 8005](https://www.google.com/search?q=3M+Scotch-Weld%E2%84%A2+DP+8005) a 2 component glue which cannot be purchased by private persons and even not to profesional glue guys without having them a special mandatory
  security instruction. Besides that it is really expensive.
- [technicollÂ® 9310](https://www.technicoll.eu/adhesive/technicoll-9310-3.html) a hot glue system which is easy to handle and relatively cheap.

## Foam

I planned to add some extra support to the stacks by using some foam between the stack and the rails.
It was not easy to find the right type, looks like there is no easy to stomach system which describes the impressionability of the different types of foam.

I found this description from [Caseclub Foam Types](https://www.caseclub.com/different-types-of-foam-for-cases/) useful - especially the picture with the clamp.

After buying wrong (very squeezeble) foam, i am trying now FIXME
