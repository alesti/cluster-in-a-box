# Connect the inner cage to the case

I am not yet sure if i want to connect the alu frame in a solid way to the case. 
It might be also possible to habe a tight fit but no direct connection.

But if, i need to explore the possibilities.

There are slots on the brim of the lid and the bottom, and the manufacturer has
matching hardware to slot in.

I am pretty sure that i will not use this in the
bottom, but i might use them in the lid.

Typical connections left are glueing and riveting/screwing.  

## Rivets and Screws

Screwing and riveting will reduce the water tightness of the case, but i would
not care. But there are holes in it afterwards.

The box has really rugged surface on the outside, it would need good planing to
find spots with no webs, web connections and similar.  

It might be possibe to drill holes with a template from the inside and use m5
screws which washers Karosseriescheiben connect into t-slot nuts. 

I am pretty sure not to use rivets in that case, even if i have the tools to set proper rivets.
I like connections which are revertable without a drill.

## Glue

Read the last sentence again :-) But anyhow:

The case is made from polypropylen which counts as a low adhesive material.
This needs special glue, i found three types:

- speed glue, but not very elastic, does not fill gaps
- 2 component glue from M3 Scotch which will not selled to private persons and
  even not to profesional gluers without having them a special mandatory
  security instruction.
- a hot glue system which is easy to handle
