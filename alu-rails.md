# Inner construction 

I need some material to store and connect 3 of the [Odroid stacks](stackrack.md) safely in the
box. 

I have a small wood workshop, but wood (multiplex boards and
similar) looking not suitable for this project.  I started to search for aluminium system
profiles. 

## Aluminium system profiles

These system profiles use grooves (named t-slots) on squared profiles which can
use suitable t-slot nuts with threads in them to connect to other profiles with
some specialized connector types for different connections.

In europe are two predominant, quite similar looking but not compatible
systems present, i do not know if other markets have them also or use different
systems. 

These systems are named with a letter for the inventors (B for Bosch-Rexroth
or I for Item), there are a lot of other manufacturers which build them also,
all profiles of one type are compatible to the same system.

The differences between the systems are the shapes of the t-slots, the shapes
of the nuts and their thread diameters - from my perspective: It does not
matter which system is used, but you need to stay into the choosen system.

I found this (german) pages useful to dive into the alu profile thingie:
- [Aluprofile - Materialkunde](https://www.franzek.com/aluprofile-materialkunde)
- [Aluprofilverbinder und Nutsteine](https://www.franzek.com/aluprofilverbinder-und-nutensteine-camper-ausbau/)

The profiles are available from 20mm edge length up to 80mm, Item provides a
profile in a [wood compound
material](https://www.item24.com/de-de/profil-kh-8-40x40-anthrazit-62686) which
looks very interesting for me (it can be worked with wood sawblades and other
wood tools), but only on 40x40mm - i am very sure that 20x20 is strong enough
for this purpose.

After some wild drawings to get a somehow realistic idea how many running
meters of that profile system i would need, i decided to buy  I-type rails in
20x20mm with 5mm t-slot, the t-slot nuts (FIXME Link/Bild) with a sphere (these
can be slotted in in every position, not only from the end). The diameter of
the threads in these nuts is M5.

I bought also plenty 90Â° angles, t-slot nuts and suitable (lol, read later)
screws to construct an inner cage for the odroid stacks and for the display in
the lid.

I bought also some metal working stuff i had not so far: 
- An aluminium blade for my miter saw
- A M5 thread cutter (to grind threads into the end of a profile) and 
- A steel needle to apply marks for measurements.

Despide i am a desperate stick welder on agriculture equipement and other 
big game stuff, and i am also able to handle an angle grinder properly i do not
consider me as a full metal guy, but hey - its only aluminium and there is also
a tools chapter later to describe that better.

## Some impressions


### t-slot nuts

There are different types.  For me important: I need to set or remove them at
any time, even if rails are already screwed together.  There are types which
can only applied from the front side (slide in).  Other can be squeesed in
anywhere, some of them click in right in place, other needed to be fidled into
the right position and directly screewd to be manageble and not flipping in a
bad position.

FIXME 

### Screws

Its a system. You need right the right screws - i ordered the rails, t-slot
nuts, screws, angels all together to
