# The Box

I have some experiences in the live music / festival industry, so i am familar
with [flightcases](https://www.google.com/search?q=flightcase+pictures). Almost
all of them have wheels - they are really heavy duty
and need effort to move them around even if they are empty; you need to
protect the surroundings against their corners, you need a truck and not a car
to transport them. => No flightcase in this project.

I liked the idea of using a [PeliCase](https://www.peli.com/) or similar
solution.  They are really stable, light for the grade of protection, some of
them have wheels and a retractable handle.

There are a lot of similar but different brands - i found this [comparison -
Pelican Case Alternatives](https://www.gwp.co.uk/guides/peli-case-alternatives/)
helpful to get a first glimpse.

I aimed for a box with wheels and a handle, i do not need a swimming,
waterproof, bullet proof expedition solution which works at -20Â°C.

I wanted to store 3 stacks with 4 Odroids each, a power supply and switches in it, the
lid should be deep enough to hold a display or a tablet.

I made some wild measurements (my odroid stack is 330 x 170 x 170 millimeters
(yep, sorry us folks, we believe in metric measurements here), so three of them
need about 510 mm) and decided to go for a box with an inner volume of about 750
x 350 x 250 mm . 

I found the best intersection (bang for bugs) in a cases from [Explorer
Cases](https://www.explorercases.com/en/home/) - they are about half of the
price (in germany) of the Pelicases and looked sturdy enough for my purpose.  

I decided to buy a [ExplorerCase
7626HL](https://www.explorercases.com/en/products/7626hl/) in black (needed some
time to decide not to opt for the orange one) with 763 x 399 x 260 mm inner
volume, a first fitting looks like there is plenty room for three stacks and
some more in it:

This box is really sturdy, it has five self-locking latches, a retractable
handle on the backside and preformed mountpoints to connect an inner
construction to the box in the base and in the lid (they provide suitable connectors for
these mountpoints). The hinges for the lid have some points where the have
higher friction to let the lid stay open.  I do not like the wheels, they are
made by hard plastic - i consider to change them by something with more flexibility
in it.

The offical measures do not follow the bulges which are needed for the wheels
and the handle, but i predicted that with their detail drawings.
